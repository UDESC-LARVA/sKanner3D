## Abstract

> In computer graphics, deformations are used to change the  appearance  of  an  object,  regardless  if  it  is  2D  or 3D. These deformations can be applied in many areas, such   as   games,   entertainment,   health,   education, fashion, textile industry, and so on. This paper presents a   literature   mapping   on   3D   human   whole   body deformations.   It   aims   to   identify   techniques   and procedures   applied   in   the   deformation   of   Virtual Humans  oriented  by  physiological  aspects,  such  as  growth or  weight - gain  that  impact  Body  Image – the study  on  how  a  person  sees  his  own  body.  The  search was performed in  ACM  Digital  Library, IEEE Xplore, Engineering   Village   and   Scopus.   Altogether,   7279 documents   were   obtained   but   only   11   papers   met inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria.  Data  show  that  few researches    provide    model    deformation    based    on physiological  laws  and  that  available  techniques  are  focused on mathematical issues or interactions.
